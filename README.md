Hello Odin!!
## Git cheat sheet 
This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. Try to familiarize yourself with the
commands so that you can eventually remember them all:
## *_Commands related to a remote repository:_*
git clone
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this
context)
## *_Commands related to the workflow:_*
```
git add .
git comit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
```
## *_Commands related to checking status or log history:_*
```
git status
git log
```
The basic Git syntax is 
```
program | action | destination .
```
For example,
is read as git I add I
git add .
where the period represents everything in the current directory;
